# stable_lm_1_6b.py - Enhanced Conversational AI Model

This repository provides a simple Python script for interacting with the `stabilityai/stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b` language model from Hugging Face. It has been enhanced with additional features by Gemini Advanced for a more engaging and user-friendly experience.

## Features

* **Continuous Conversation:** Engage in natural back-and-forth dialogue with the model.
* **Context Awareness:** The model remembers past interactions to provide contextually relevant responses.
* **Temperature Control:** Adjust the `temperature` parameter to influence the creativity and focus of the model's output.
* **Graceful Exit:** Easily end the conversation by typing "exit".

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [invalid URL removed]

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

(Make sure you have the correct path to requirements.txt in your terminal or command prompt)

## Usage

1. Run the script from your terminal:
   ```bash
   python stable_lm_1_6b.py

Start chatting with the model. Type "exit" to quit.

Additional Notes

    This script leverages the transformers library from Hugging Face, so make sure you have enough RAM to load the model (~8GB recommended).
    You can experiment with different values for the temperature parameter to see how it affects the model's responses.
    This script is a modification of the original example provided by Hugging Face. It has been adapted to run efficiently on a CPU and include the additional features mentioned above.
